# README Generator

Generate a professional, comprehensive README.md by scanning the actual project structure and code.

## Workflow

1. **Scan the project**:
   - Run `ls -la` to see the root structure
   - Read `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `Gemfile`, `pom.xml`, or equivalent to identify the language, framework, and dependencies
   - Run `find . -type f -name "*.md" | head -20` to check for existing docs
   - Read the existing README if one exists (to preserve any content the user wants to keep)
   - Check for `.env.example` or config files to identify required environment variables
   - Check for `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `Makefile`, or CI config

2. **Detect project characteristics**:
   - Language and framework
   - Build tool and package manager
   - Test framework
   - Deployment method
   - License file

3. **Generate the README** with these sections (skip any that do not apply):

### Required sections:
- **Project title**: The project name as an H1, with a one-line description below it
- **About**: 2-4 sentences explaining what this project does, who it is for, and what problem it solves. Do not be generic. Reference specific functionality found in the codebase.
- **Getting Started**: Prerequisites, installation steps, and how to run the project locally. Use the actual commands found in package.json scripts, Makefile targets, or equivalent. Include environment variable setup if `.env.example` exists.
- **Usage**: How to use the project after installation. Include at least one concrete example (CLI command, API call, import statement, or screenshot placeholder).

### Optional sections (include only when relevant):
- **Tech Stack**: Only if the project uses multiple technologies worth calling out
- **Project Structure**: Only for projects with 10+ directories or non-obvious organization. Use a tree view, keep it to the top 2 levels.
- **API Reference**: Only if the project exposes an API. Summarize key endpoints or methods.
- **Configuration**: Only if there are meaningful configuration options beyond basic env vars
- **Testing**: Only if there is a test suite. Show how to run tests and what frameworks are used.
- **Deployment**: Only if deployment config exists (Dockerfile, CI/CD, cloud config)
- **Contributing**: Only if the project is open source or has multiple contributors
- **License**: Only if a LICENSE file exists. State the license type and link to the file.

4. **Present the README** for review. Ask if the user wants to adjust any section before writing the file.

## Rules

- Never include badges unless the user asks for them. Unused badges look worse than no badges.
- Never include placeholder text like "Add your description here" or "TODO". Every line must be real content derived from the actual project.
- Write in the second person ("you") for instructions. Write in the third person for descriptions ("This tool does X").
- Keep the entire README under 300 lines. A README that nobody reads is worse than a short one.
- Use fenced code blocks with the correct language identifier for all commands and code samples.
- If the project has no tests, no CI, and no deployment config, do not add those sections with made-up content.
- Prefer showing real commands from the project over generic examples.
